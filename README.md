## Calibrating Video Timestamps

**Important**: The pause points are estimated. You may need to adjust them:

1. Open `index.html` in a text editor
2. Find the `pausePoints` array (around line 270)
3. Adjust the `time` values (in seconds) to match your video

**Current estimated timestamps:**
```
Personal Development Brainstorm: ~4:55 (295s)
Timeline Assignment: ~11:05 (665s)
Top 3 Selection: ~12:00 (720s)
... and so on
```

**To find exact timestamps:**
1. Watch the video in a regular player
2. Note the time (in seconds) when Tony says "begin" or "start"
3. Update the `time` value in the pausePoints array

## Tips for the Workshop

1. **Minimize distractions** - Put phones away, close other tabs
2. **Have supplies ready** - Pen and paper backup is great
3. **Keep writing** - Don't stop during brainstorming, even if it feels silly
4. **Be honest** - These are YOUR goals, not what you think you "should" want
5. **Do it together** - Take turns, or do it simultaneously as a family

## Printing Your Goals

After completing the workshop:
1. Click "View Summary"
2. Click "Print Goals"
3. Choose your printer or "Save as PDF"
4. Frame it or put it in your journal!

## Troubleshooting

**Video won't play?**
- Make sure `tony-robbins-day12.mp4` is in the `video/` folder
- Try a different browser (Chrome works best)

**Goals not saving?**
- Make sure you're not in private/incognito mode
- Goals are saved per-browser (Chrome saves separately from Firefox)

**Timestamps off?**
- See "Calibrating Video Timestamps" above
- The timing depends on your specific video file
